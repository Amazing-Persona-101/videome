This project is made available under a dual-license scheme.
You may choose to use this software under either of the following licenses:

  (A) The GNU Affero General Public License, version 3 or
      (at your option) any later version ("AGPL-3.0-or-later").

  (B) The Apache License, version 2.0 ("Apache-2.0").

------------------------------------------------------------

How to choose:

The AGPL-3.0-or-later is a strong copyleft license. It requires that if you
modify the software and make it available to others over a network, you
must also make the source code of your modified version available to
those users under the same license. Choose this license if you are
building a derivative work that you also want to be open source.

The Apache-2.0 license is a permissive license. It allows you to use,
modify, and distribute the software with very few restrictions. You can
incorporate it into proprietary, closed-source products, but you must
include the original copyright and license notices.

You may not mix and match provisions from the two licenses. You must
choose one and comply with all of its terms.

Copies of both licenses are included in this repository:
- AGPL-3.0.txt
- APACHE-2.0.txt

Third-party components:

This project may include or depend on third-party components with their
own licenses. For example, it uses the RealTimeKit SDK by Cloudflare,
which is licensed under the Apache License 2.0. You are responsible for
complying with the licenses of all components you use. See the NOTICE.txt
